<h1>VirtualPULSE</h1>
[VirtualPULSE](http://virtualpulse.buildsci.us/) is a holistic web based simulation platform for building energy, urban solar radiation & urban airlflow. It uses OpenStudio under the hood to assist in generating models and running simulations. The website offers a full workflow on its own, but you can also take resulting models out as OSM models for further inspection, modeling, and simulation.

## Bring Models Into OpenStudio.
You can start your workflow using the [VirtualPULSE](http://virtualpulse.buildsci.us/) workflow, and then bring in models from selected buildings into OpenStudio. At that point they are like any other OpenStudio models.
