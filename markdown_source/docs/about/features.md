<h1>Current Features</h1>
The OpenStudio Application uses the [OpenStudio SDK](https://openstudio-sdk-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The features that are available in the current major release are described below.

## As of OpenStudio Application Version 1.0.0

### Building Geometry/3D CAD

- Import geometry from gbXML files (from Revit, GreenBuildingStudio, Trace700, etc.)
- Import geometry from EnergyPlus files (IDF)
- Import model from SDD files (California Energy Commission)
- Import geometry from Industry Foundation Class files (IFC)
- Assign and visually inspect space types assignments
- Define thermal zones and add/remove spaces
- Assign and see building envelope constructions

#### FloorspceJS

- Draw 2D building geometry (that will be extruded to 3D) using the built-in FloorspaceJS interface
- Trace images of floor plans, or maps 
- Building envelope, shading on windows, shading from other buildings, etc.
- Assign constructions, space types, thermal zones
- Add daylighting sensors

#### Sketchup Plugin

- Draw 3D building geometry using free plugin for SketchUp
- Building envelope, shading on windows, shading from other buildings, etc.
- Draw detailed shapes, trace floor plans, or a combination
- Use wizard to create standard shapes (H, L, E, Courtyard, Rectangle)
- Add daylighting sensors

#### Building Geometry Tool Matrix

The following table is intended to provide users with some guidance around which of the primary geometry tools may be best suited to a given modeling scenario. In general, if the model will suffice with relatively simple geometry elements and doesn't require the use of external 3D drawing files or imported geometry from other models, then FloorspaceJS is typically quicker and creates simpler elements that run faster. If there is a need to represent more complicated 3D shapes or work with thrid party drawing and model files, then the SketchUp Plugin may be needed. Also keep in mind that geoetry created in FloorspaceJS can be brought into SketchUp (as an OSM file), but FloorspaceJS will not recognize geometry from any other source. So in some cases it may make sense to begin simpler forms in FloorspaceJS and transition to SketchUp for later, more detailed representations.
