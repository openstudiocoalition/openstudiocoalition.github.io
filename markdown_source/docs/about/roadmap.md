<h1>Roadmap Features</h1>
After the v1.0.0 NREL-provided software distribution, the OpenStudio Application will continue to be supported with open source contributions by The OpenStudio Coalition and members of the software community. Plans include support for releasing new versions of the OpenStudio Application that stay aligned with scheduled releases of the OpenStudio SDK, with minimal or no changes to the user interface. Additionally, critical bugfix releases may be provided, on an as-needed basis. 

The OpenStudio SDK, OpenStudio Command Line Interface (CLI), OpenStudio Server, OpenStudio Standards, OpenStudio Measures, Floorspace.JS Widget (Floorspace), Building Component Library (BCL), and Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT) will be unaffected. However, these tools will continue to be developed, distributed, and maintained by NREL. See [https://www.openstudio.net/new-future-for-openstudio-application](https://www.openstudio.net/new-future-for-openstudio-application) for details. 

## Partnerships and Open Source Software Contribution Opportunities

Effective early May 2020, NREL will no longer distribute the OpenStudio Application and the SketchUp Plugin. The final NREL software distribution of the OpenStudio Application, along with any non-NREL future releases, will be available at [https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudioApplication/releases](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudioApplication/releases). Companies, individual contributors, and organizations that are interested in providing development contributions, support and maintenance activities for the OpenStudio Application, including new features, defect fixes and enhancements, are encouraged to contact OSC@openstudiocoalition.org.
