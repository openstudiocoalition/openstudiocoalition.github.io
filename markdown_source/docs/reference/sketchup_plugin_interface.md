#### New OpenStudio Model
This tool closes your current OpenStudio Model and creates a new one. On a Mac it creates an empty model and you have to go under the menu item __Extentions/OpenStudio User Scripts/On-Demand Template Generators/Space Type and Construction Set Wizard__ to add template items like constructions, schedules, and space types. On a PC the template dialog will be available once and you can choose templates. If you want to add additional template types you must go to the __Extentions/OpenStudio User Scripts/On-Demand Template Generators/Space Type and Construction Set Wizard__. </td>

<tr>
<td>![Open OpenStudio Model Icon](img/plugin_reference_guide/OSOpen-24_0.png)</td>

#### Open OpenStudio Model
Use this feature to close your current OpenStudio Model and open an OpenStudio file (.osm). It does not close your current SketchUp file, but loads a different OpenStudio Model into it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>![Save OpenStudio Model Icon](img/plugin_reference_guide/OSSave-24_0.png)</td>
<td>
#### Save OpenStudio Model
Saves your OpenStudio Model as an OpenStudio file (.osm). If you save your OSM file and then save your SketchUp Model, the SketchUp Model will maintain a link to the OSM. If you close and reopen your linked SketchUp file (.skp), it will reload the content from the OSM file. All the energy model content is saved in the OSM file, not in the SketchUp file.

The benefit of having a link to a SketchUp file is to maintain a relationship with non-OpenStudio content that you may have in your model, such as a base plan or base model. A linked SketchUp file also has saved scenes, drawing styles, and section cut location. When saving your OpenStudio Model, make sure your filename ends with the ".osm" extension. If it does not have that extension, OpenStudio will not open the file. If you have files without this extension, you can manually rename them; they should open.</td>

#### Save As OpenStudio Model
Using this feature saves your OpenStudio Model as a new OSM file and updates the SketchUp file to link to the newly saved OSM file.

When saving your OpenStudio Model, make sure your filename ends with the ".osm" extension. If it does not have this extension, OpenStudio will not open the file. If you have files without this extension, you can manually rename them; they should open.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>![Import EnergyPlus Input Data File Icon](img/plugin_reference_guide/import_idf.png)</td>
<td>
#### Import EnergyPlus Input Data File (IDF)
This feature functions similarly to the Import OpenStudio Model tool. If you import an entire IDF Model, your current OpenStudio Model is closed and a new one is created from your IDF. When you import and then save an IDF Model, you will be prompted to save it as an OSM file. If you want to keep it as an IDF, you can choose the Export EnergyPlus Input Data File tool instead of the Save OpenStudio Model tool. If you have added geometry or other objects, such as interior partitions that are unique to an OpenStudio Model, you will lose or alter those objects when you export back to an IDF.

Like the Import OpenStudio Model tool, the Import EnergyPlus Input Data File tool can be used to import additional content into your model. In this import workflow, your OpenStudio Model stays open and the import tool adds additional content from a previously saved IDF.

Content types that can be imported from an IDF:

- Constructions (including materials)
- Schedules

You can access these features under the Extensions/OpenStudio menu or the `File->Import` menu. *Space Loads* are unique to an OpenStudio Model, so they cannot be imported from an IDF.

[![Import Dialog](img/plugin_reference_guide/OpenStudioImportMenu_0.png)](img/plugin_reference_guide/OpenStudioImportMenu_0.png)

*Above: Import dialog allows you to import OSM files, constructions, schedules, and space loads. You can also import IDFs, gbXMLs, and SDDs through this menu.*

<tr>
<td>![Export IDF Icon](img/plugin_reference_guide/IDFExport-24.png)
</td>
<td>
#### Export EnergyPlus Input Data File
Use this tool when exporting an IDF from an OSM. This can be useful if you need an IDF to use in an application that does not support the new OSM file format. Some model data may be lost when exporting to an IDF because the OSM file format supports many objects, such as interior partition groups and surfaces, that are not in EnergyPlus. If you export an OSM  file with unsupported elements to an IDF, and then reimport it into OpenStudio, the unsupported elements will be gone.

Good practice for a typical workflow is to always use your OSM file as the working file. You can run simulations in EnergyPlus directly from an OSM file by using the OpenStudio RunManager application as a stand-alone application or through the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in interface.

When exploring an IDF, make sure your file name ends with the ".idf" extension. If it does not have this extension, EnergyPlus and other applications may not open the file. If you have files without this extension, you can manually rename them; they should open.

<td>
#### Import OpenStudio Model
This tool can function similarly to the Open OpenStudio Model tool. If you import an entire model, your current model is closed and a new one loaded. When you import an OSM file and then save the OpenStudio Model, you will be prompted for a new filename. This prevents you from accidentally overwriting your original file.

The Import OpenStudio Model tool can also be used to import additional content into your model. In this import workflow, your OpenStudio Model stays open and the Import tool adds content from a previously saved OSM file (see the Import dialog image above.) Content types that can be imported from an OSM file follow:

- Constructions (including construction sets, constructions, and materials)
- Schedules
- Space loads

#### Export OpenStudio Model
This tool prompts you for a new filename for your saved file. As you continue to work, you alter your original file instead of the exported file.

#### Import gbXML File
There is no toolbar icon to use for importing gbXML (Green Building XML) files; this functionality is available through the `Extensions->OpenStudio->Import->Import gbXML Model` menu item only. If you import a gbXML Model, your current OpenStudio Model is closed and a new one is created from your gbXML. When you import a gbXML Model and then save the model, you will be prompted to save it as an OSM file.

The following gbXML element types are imported from gbXML to the OpenStudio Model:

- Construction
- Material
- ScheduleDay
- ScheduleWeek
- Schedule
- Campus
- Building
- Space
- Surface
- SubSurface

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>
#### Export gbXML File
This functionality is available through the `Extensions->OpenStudio->Export->Export gbXML Model` menu item. Some information may be lost when exporting to a gbXML. This is because the OSM file format supports some object types that XMLs do not.

#### Export Untranslated EnergyPlus IDF
When an IDF is imported into the SketchUp Plug-in, a translation between EnergyPlus IDF and OpenStudio Model File occurs. OpenStudio does not yet support translation of all objects from EnergyPlus IDF to OSM file. To support users with workflows that switch between IDF and OSM file, the SketchUp Plug-in allows users to export IDF objects that were not translated during the import. These objects are written to a plain text IDF so the user may then reintegrate these untranslated objects with the IDF produced by the OSM file to IDF translation. After importing an EnergyPlus IDF, a prompt will alert the user about the objects that could not be translated to OSM file.

<td>![New Space Icon](img/plugin_reference_guide/new_space.png)
</td>
<td>
#### New Space
You can use the New Space tool to create a new OpenStudio Space. Activate the tool and then click where you want your zone origin to be. An OpenStudio Space is a top-level object in your SketchUp workspace. If you want to draw in the space, you first need to select the space, then enter it. There are two methods to select a space:

1. Click on the space. This may be difficult when other objects get in the way. 
2. Find and click on the space within SketchUp's Outliner Window. This option is suitable when option 1 is not. 

Now that the space has been selected, a user can enter the space before drawing surfaces. The three methods to enter a selected space are:

1. Double-click on the space, or double-click on the space within SketchUp's Outliner Window. 
2. Right-click on the space, or right-click on the space within SketchUp's Outliner Window. From the resulting contextual menu, click "Edit Group".
3. Click the Edit menu. Under this menu, choose "Group", or "Solid Group". Then click "Edit Group".

While inside a space, beside drawing spaces, you can add objects. Shading groups, interior partition groups, daylighting control points, and luminance maps can be added to a space. An alternate method to make new spaces is to copy and paste existing spaces. After creating a space and adding any objects, you can edit them using the [OpenStudio Inspector](#openstudio-inspector).

#### New Shading Surface Group
The New Shading Surface Group tool is used to create a new EnergyPlus shading group. Activate the tool and then click where you want your shading group origin to be. An EnergyPlus shading group can be a top-level object in your SketchUp workspace, or it can be placed within a space. If you want to draw in the group, you first need to select the group, then enter it. There are two methods to select a group:

1. Click on the group. This may be difficult when other objects get in the way. 
2. Find and click on the group within SketchUp's Outliner Window. This option is suitable when option 1 is not. 

Now that the group has been selected, a user can enter the group before drawing Surfaces. The three methods to enter a selected group are:

1. Double-click on the group, or double-click on the group within SketchUp's Outliner Window. 
2. Right-click on the group, or right-click on the group within SketchUp's Outliner Window. From the resulting contextual menu, click "Edit Group".
3. Click the Edit menu. Under this menu, choose "Group", or "Solid Group". Then click "Edit Group".

You can create shading surface groups within or outside a space. Once you enter into a shading surface group, you can draw shading surfaces. An alternate method to make new shading groups is to copy and paste existing groups.

#### New Interior Partition Surface Group
The New Interior Partition Surface Group tool is used to create a new OpenStudio Interior Partition Group. Activate the tool and then click where you want your interior partition group origin to be. If you want to draw in the group, you first need to select the group, then enter it. There are two methods to select a group:

1. Click on the group. This may be difficult when other objects get in the way. 
2. Find and click on the group within SketchUp's Outliner Window. This option is suitable when option 1 is not. 

Now that the group has been selected, a user can enter the group before drawing surfaces. The three methods to enter a selected group are:

1. Double-click on the group, or double-click on the group within SketchUp's Outliner Window. 
2. Right-click on the group, or right-click on the group within SketchUp's Outliner Window. From the resulting contextual menu, click "Edit Group".
3. Click the Edit menu. Under this menu, choose "Group", or "Solid Group". Then click "Edit Group".

You can create interior partition groups within a space only. Once you enter into an interior partition group, you can draw interior partition surfaces. An alternate method to make new interior partition groups is to copy and paste existing groups. Interior partition surfaces are not used as heat transfer surfaces, but they still have an associated construction. This construction, along with the surface area, is used to create internal mass that is used to run simulations and create objects for IDF export.

#### New Daylighting Control Object
The New Daylighting Control Object tool creates a new OpenStudio Daylighting Control object. This consists of a single sensor, which by default will be placed 30 inches above the surface you click on. You can move the object with the SketchUp Move tool or via the OpenStudio Inspector, and you can set many attributes that feed information to EnergyPlus and [Radiance Daylighting Measure](https://bcl.nrel.gov/node/84189). The Glare Calculation Azimuth Angle of View Direction also changes the appearance of the object in OpenStudio. To report data from the sensors in EnergyPlus, you also need to include light objects in your model. Most space types in the template files already include a light object.

You can create a daylighting control object from within a space, or you can copy and paste one from one space to another.

![Daylighting Control Objects](img/plugin_reference_guide/width_SU_DaylightingControlObjects.png)

*Above: Screenshot of daylighting controls objects inside a space*

![Daylighting Control Object Selected](img/plugin_reference_guide/width_Inspector_DaylightingControl.png)

#### New Illuminance Map
The New Illuminance Map tool creates a new OpenStudio Illuminance Map object. This consists of a rectangle with a grid representing map data points. By default it will be placed 30 inches above the surface you click on. You can move and resize the illuminance map with the SketchUp Move and Scale tools and through the OpenStudio Inspector. To obtain data reported for the map in EnergyPlus, you also need to include a daylighting controls object and lights. Most space types in the template files already include a light object.

You can create an illuminance map from  within a space, or you can copy and paste the map into a different space. You can have multiple illuminance maps in a space.

The New Glare Sensor creates a new OpenStudio Glare Sensor that supports [Radiance Daylighting Measure](https://bcl.nrel.gov/node/84189) simulations. Unlike the illuminance map and daylighting control point, the glare sensor has no connection to a thermal zone. The default placement of the sensor is 30 inches above the surface you click on. You can move the object with the SketchUp Move tool or through the OpenStudio Inspector, and you can set many attributes that feed information to Radiance.

You can create a glare sensor object from within a space, or you can copy and paste one into a different space.

#### Set Space Attributes
The Space Attributes tool can be used to set attributes for one or more selected spaces in your OpenStudio Model. The first four pull-down menus (Space Type, Building Story, Construction Set, and Thermal Zone) set attributes of the selected space objects. The last two pull-down menus set attributes in the thermal zone associated with the selected spaces. Most of the menus allow you to choose from a list populated by the appropriate model objects or one of the following options: No Change, Clear Field, or Make a new Object. The exception is the ideal air loads, which has a "no change" option, or yes/no. The Thermostat menu is similar to the others, but does not offer the option to create a new thermostat.

<td>![Create Spaces from Diagrams Icon](img/plugin_reference_guide/extrude.png)

#### Create Spaces from Diagrams
The Space Diagram tool allows you to use native SketchUp tools to draw a space diagram representing your building's floor plan. After drawing the diagram, you can select the surfaces and create a single-story or multistory building based on the diagram. Your model will have one Space for each surface in your diagram for each floor. You can use this tool multiple times. If you want to create a new diagram with a unique floor for higher floors, just repeat the steps you used for the original diagram.

Surfaces that are not horizontal will be ignored; surfaces with improper surface normals will be flipped over. Once made, the spaces are like any other OpenStudio Space. You can enter the space and alter or extend your geometry to refine it beyond the basic geometry created by the Space Diagram tool.

![Space Diagram Dialog](img/plugin_reference_guide/width_SU_SpaceDigram_a.png)

*Above: Screenshot of Space Diagram dialog box*

The following image shows the resulting model after using the Space Diagram tool. The loose geometry of the diagram will be saved onto a layer in SketchUp named "OpenStudio - Space Diagrams". Although the resulting spaces are saved in your OpenStudio Model (OSM file), the diagram is not. If you want to keep the diagram, you can save the SketchUp file as well. Even if you do not save the SketchUp file you will still have access to the diagram until you quit. If you want to make a change to the diagram, you can delete the spaces, alter the diagram, and re-project them.

<td>![Project Loose Geometry Icon](img/plugin_reference_guide/project_geo.png)

#### Project Loose Geometry
The Project Loose Geometry tool allows you to use the native SketchUp tools to draw loose geometry onto surfaces of your building envelope. When you are ready to project these surfaces into the spaces of your model, you can open this tool and run it across all loose geometry or the selected loose geometry. Although this is often used to create fenestration, it can also be used to split a base surface into two base surfaces. The advantage of this tool--versus the traditional method of entering and drawing within a space--is that you can quickly create surfaces across many spaces without having to ever enter those spaces.

If some of the surfaces you have selected are not in the same plane as a building surface, they will be ignored.

![Project Loose Geometry Dialog](img/plugin_reference_guide/width_SU_ProjectGeo_a.png)

*Above: Screenshot of Project Loose Geometry dialog box*

The image below shows the resulting model after you have projected selected loose geometry. The loose geometry used for the projection operation will be moved to a layer in SketchUp named "OpenStudio - Loose Geometry". While the surfaces made in the spaces by the projection are saved in your OpenStudio Model (OSM file), the loose geometry is not saved in the OpenStudio Model. If you want to save this for future use, you can save the SketchUp file as well.

<td>![OpenStudio Inspector Icon](img/plugin_reference_guide/Inspector-24.png)</td>
<td>
#### OpenStudio Inspector
The OpenStudio Inspector displays information about your currently open OpenStudio Model. The Inspector Window is divided into three main areas:

1. The top left is the Select Type pane. This has a partial list of OpenStudio object types and identifies how many objects of a specific type are in your model.
2. The bottom left pane is the Select Object pane. If you make a selection in the Select Type pane, a list of objects of that type will be displayed in the Select Object pane. The objects listed in the Select Object pane have a number to indicate how many objects in the model refer to this object. Below the list are several buttons. The Plus button to create a new object of this type, a Copy button to copy the selected object, a minus button to delete the selected object, and a Purge button to purge unused objects of this type. For some object types, one or more of these buttons may be disabled.
3. The third and last pane of the Inspector is the Edit Object pane at the right. This displays the fields for the currently selected object in the Select Object pane. Some fields accept a string; others are edited via a pull-down list. For some object types, some fields may be hidden from the Inspector or locked from editing. This is by design.

The OpenStudio Inspector is render mode aware. If you are in a render by class or render by boundary condition and use the SketchUp select tool to select a space, the OpenStudio Space will be selected in the Inspector. If, however, you are in render by space type, thermal zone, or story mode, a space type, thermal zone, or story will be selected in the Inspector. This is assuming that the space is an assigned space type, thermal zone, or story. The Render by Construction mode is similar, but you need to select a surface versus a space to select a construction object in the Inspector. Currently, if you select a thermal zone, space type, or construction object in the Inspector, it will not make a selection in the SketchUp Model that correlates to this object.

The Inspector cannot select multiple objects at once. So if you select multiple spaces or surfaces in SketchUp, only one will be active in the Inspector. Similarly, you cannot use the Inspector to batch change the attributes for multiple objects at once.

The [Set Space Attributes for Selected Spaces](#set-space-attributes) tool on the OpenStudio Toolbar does allow batch changes for space objects, and to a limited extent for zones that parent the spaces.

#### Surface Search
The OpenStudio Surface Search tool enables you to search your model for surfaces with specific attributes. You can select the search results and visually isolate them by hiding all other surfaces. When you are finished, click "Unhide All" on the Surface Search Dialog to unhide the rest of the surfaces. Before searching on a large IDF, close SketchUp's Outliner Window to expedite the surface searching. While surfaces are hidden you can also use SketchUp's built-in "View Hidden Geometry" to quickly view all hidden surfaces.

You can also search based on Surface Orientation. To do this, set both "from" and "to" to a single value if you want to find surfaces that face a specific direction, or you can set unique values to show surfaces within a range of angles. "Exclude Horizontal Surfaces" is generally intended to be used along with Surface Orientation search to hide surfaces with no azimuth. There are also check boxes to limit search results to non-convex surfaces or to surfaces with more than a set number of vertices. Once your search is complete, the resulting surfaces are selected in SketchUp. You can use this selection for other operations or scripts.

When you create new geometry, it will be automatically classified and rendered. If you try to assign a color yourself, the application will override you. You never need to use the paint bucket tool in this render mode.

If you set a surface construction to "Air Boundary", it will be rendered as a translucent checkerboard pattern. This construction is intended to represent thermal zone boundaries that do not represent physical walls in the building.

The OpenStudio Render by Outside Boundary Condition mode will render surfaces by their outside boundary conditions. Only space surfaces have boundary conditions, so only they will be rendered with a color. Shading and interior partition surfaces will be white. This is a good rendering mode to diagnose problems with your model. It provides a quick way to globally look at boundary conditions throughout your model. You never need to use the paint bucket tool in this render mode. In the screenshot below, a section cut has been drawn to reveal the inside of the model, making the boundary condition of surfaces easy to see.

If you set a surface construction to "Air Boundary", it will be rendered as a translucent checkerboard pattern. This construction is intended to represent thermal zone boundaries that do not represent physical walls in the building.

The most common boundary conditions you will see are "Outdoors, Surface, and Ground", but there are actually 9 basic boundary modes, with a number of subsets within some conditions. For "Outdoors" there are also unique color variations to indicate if there is sun and or wind exposure. The following image shows the SketchUp materials for the various boundary conditions.

#### Render by Construction
The OpenStudio Render by Construction mode renders surfaces by their construction. Although this seems similar to Render by Surface Type, there are a number of differences:

The Inspector Window is divided into three main areas:

- In Render by Construction mode, surfaces are rendered by their construction, so if two windows do not have the same construction they will not have the same render color. The same logic is applied to other surface types.
- Shading surfaces and interior partitions can have constructions assigned. If they do have constructions, they will be rendered just as space surfaces are.
- Construction properties of a surface can be applied directly to a surface, or they can be inherited from other objects (space, space type, story, or building). The first time you click the Render by Construction button, it shows hard assigned and inherited constructions. If you click it again, it shows only hard assigned constructions. Other surfaces do not have a render color. Clicking the Render button again returns you to the default mode where hard assigned and inherited constructions are shown.

As a note, this is not a render by material mode. Hence, two constructions that have the same outside material will have unique render colors. However, in this render mode you can set render color using either the SketchUp Paint Bucket or the Inspector. To use the Inspector, select the construction object and set the RGB values. These color settings are part of the OpenStudio Model and will be maintained the next time you open the model.

#### Render by Space Type
The OpenStudio Render by Space Type mode renders each space based on the space type assigned to it. This is a two state button. The first time you click it, hard assigned and inherited space types are rendered. If you click it again, only hard assigned space types are given a render color. Space types can be assigned to a space or inherited from the building object. You can assign space types to a space by using the Set Attributes for Selected Spaces tool or the OpenStudio Inspector. The installed templates have preassigned colors for each space type, but you can use SketchUp's Paint Bucket tool or the OpenStudio Inspector to change the colors. These changes are saved as part of your OpenStudio Model.

#### Render by Thermal Zone
The OpenStudio Render by Thermal Zone mode renders each space based on the thermal zone assigned to it. You can assign a thermal zone to a space using the Set Attributes for Selected Spaces tool or the OpenStudio Inspector. When a new thermal zone is made, a color will be assigned to it. You can change that color using SketchUp's Paint Bucket tool or the OpenStudio Inspector. These changes are saved as part of your OpenStudio Model.

#### Render by Building Story
The OpenStudio Render by Building Story mode renders each space based on the building story assigned to it. You can assign a building story to a space using the Set Attributes for Selected Spaces tool or the OpenStudio Inspector. When a new story is made, a color will be assigned to it. You can change that color by using SketchUp's Paint Bucket tool or the OpenStudio Inspector. These changes are saved as part of your OpenStudio Model.

When you use the Create Spaces from Diagram tool to generate a multistory building the stories are assigned as part of that process. There is also a user script that can infer building stories from a model that has none assigned.

#### Render by Layer
Render by Layer is a standard SketchUp feature. It will render content by layer. You can create layers to represent anything you want to track. For example, to organize your project by space types you can create or move zones to specific layers. Keep in mind that the layer structure isn't saved with the OSM file, so any layers you setup are just for your current session.

#### Render by Surface Normal
The Render by Surface Normal mode is built on the SketchUp face setting where faces are rendered with the default front and back colors as opposed to their assigned materials. The outside face of a heat transfer surface will render white and the inside face will render red. This works as a quick diagnostic tool to look for reversed faces. In a clean model you shouldn't see red from the outside. Shading surfaces are an exception to this where you will see red on one of the two sides of each shading surface.
