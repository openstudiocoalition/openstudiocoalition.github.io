          <h1>Life Cycle Cost Analysis</h1>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>Life cycle cost analysis is commonly performed by energy modelers in order to determine if energy cost savings due to reduced energy usage will be enough to justify the additional investment required to implement the conservation measure. Different projects are interested in different life cycle metrics (e.g. simple payback, net present value, etc.) and will have different cost assumptions. However, in all cases the modeler needs a way to specify costs associated with the energy conservation measures, enter utility rate tariffs related to energy use, and set life cycle cost parameters such as the analysis period length and discount rate. This document explains how to use the OpenStudio Parametric Analysis Tool (PAT) to perform each of these functions as part of a life cycle cost analysis.</p>
<p>In order to perform a parametric analysis using PAT, a user must first build a baseline OpenStudio model using a combination of the OpenStudio SketchUp plug-in to edit geometry and the OpenStudio application to edit other model components. Once the baseline model has been assembled and tested, users may apply energy conservation measures using the PAT application. Tutorials and documentation on this process are available at http://openstudio.nrel.gov/parametric-analysis-tool-tutorials.</p>
<p>The "OpenStudio Life Cycle Costing Examples" document focuses on how to add cost inputs through measures in order to extend the PAT analysis from one dealing only with energy use to one that includes life cycle cost analysis as well. The first section describes how to set life cycle cost analysis parameters. The second section describes how to input utility rate tariffs. The third section describes how to input costs related to energy conservation measures. Because energy conservation measures may have different cost assumptions for different projects (e.g. retrofit vs. new construction), several examples are given for a variety of measures showing how to input costs in different scenarios. All cost values for measure inputs are entered in constant (year 0) dollars regardless of when the costs are incurred.</p>
<h2 id="life-cycle-cost-parameters">Life Cycle Cost Parameters</h2>
<p>The most basic parameters needed for a life cycle cost analysis are the analysis period length and the discount rate. A longer analysis period accumulates more energy cost savings than a shorter period; giving energy conservation measures a better pay back relative to their initial costs. A higher discount rate devalues future energy cost savings relative to money spent on capital improvements in the present; giving energy conservation measures a lower pay back relative to their initial costs. Users may set the "Analysis Length" of their project in the PAT application using the "<strong>Set Lifecycle Cost Parameters</strong>" OpenStudio measure. This measure should be added to the simulation workflow as an always run measure so it is applied to all design alternatives in the analysis. If you don't set OpenStudio will create an object with the default length of 25 years.</p>
<h2 id="energy-conservation-measure-costs">Energy Conservation Measure Costs</h2>
<p>Once the life cycle economic parameters and utility rate tariffs have been added to the baseline model (or as always run measures in PAT), the next stage in the analysis is determining which energy conservation measures are available to the project and associated costs for each option. Because there are so many different types of energy efficiency measures (OpenStudio allows users to write their own measures) this document will focus on three measures (written by NREL) which span a range of potential options; "<strong>Replace Exterior Window Constructions with a Different Construction from the Model</strong>", "<strong>Reduce Lighting Loads By Percentage</strong>", and "<strong>Add Daylight Sensors</strong>". Each of these measures takes user input for both cost and performance; this document focuses primarily on the cost parameters. A variety of project scenarios (e.g. retrofit vs. new construction) will be explored to see how the same measure can support each scenario by using different cost inputs. Examples in this document will provide a motivating narrative to give background on why cost inputs were set to the values they are. The document will then show how the cost inputs translate to annual cash flows in the life cycle analysis. No attempt has been made to ensure that the cost inputs provided in these examples are reasonable; they are for illustrative purposes only.</p>
<h3 id="case-1-replace-exterior-window-constructions-new-construction">Case 1 - Replace Exterior Window Constructions, New Construction</h3>
<h4 id="narrative">Narrative:</h4>
<p>In this example a new construction project is considering two options for window constructions; the code minimum window construction ("Window A") and a higher performance window construction ("Window B"). The energy modeler has created a baseline model which includes both constructions. All windows in the baseline model reference "Window A"; "Window B" is not referenced by any windows in the baseline model. The energy modeler has received inputs from the cost estimator that "Window A" type windows will cost around $8/ft^2 and the "Window B" type windows will cost around $10/ft^2.</p>
<h4 id="inputs">Inputs:</h4>
<p>The first task the energy modeler needs to accomplish is to set the life cycle cost parameters by adding "Set Lifecycle Cost Parameters" as an always run measure to the simulation workflow with the following inputs:</p>
<p>Table 1.1: Set Lifecycle Cost Parameters
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Argument</th>
  <th>Value</th>
  <th>Note</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Set the length of the Study Period (years)</td>
  <td>10</td>
  <td>The life cycle analysis uses a 10 year analysis period.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></p>
<p>Next the modeler inputs utility rate costs by adding "Xcel EDA Tariff Selection and Model Setup" as an always run measure to the simulation workflow with the following inputs:</p>
<p>Table 1.2: Xcel EDA Tariff Selection and Model Setup
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Argument</th>
  <th>Value</th>
  <th>Note</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Electricity Tariff</td>
  <td>Commercial</td>
  <td>Select the small commercial electric utility rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Gas Tariff</td>
  <td>Small CG</td>
  <td>Select the small commercial gas utility rate.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></p>
<p>The next task is to add the cost of the "Window A" construction in the baseline model. This cost will be input by adding "<strong>Add Cost per Area to Construction</strong>" as an always run measure to the simulation workflow with the following inputs:</p>
<p>Table 1.3: Add Cost per Area to Construction
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Argument</th>
  <th>Value</th>
  <th>Note</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Choose a Construction to Add Costs For.</td>
  <td>Window A</td>
  <td>Name of the construction to add costs to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Remove Existing Costs?</td>
  <td>True</td>
  <td>Remove any costs previously associated with this construction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Material and Installation Costs for Construction per Area Used ($/ft^2).</td>
  <td>8</td>
  <td>Estimated cost for the baseline windows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Demolition Costs for Construction per Area Used ($/ft^2).</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>No demolition costs are modeled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Years Until Costs Start (whole years).</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>Construction costs will be incurred in year 0.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Demolition Costs Occur During Initial Construction?</td>
  <td>False</td>
  <td>No demolition required for new construction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Expected Life (whole years).</td>
  <td>30</td>
  <td>The windows are expected to last for 30 years after installation. This will be beyond the analysis period.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>O &amp; M Costs for Construction per Area Used ($/ft^2).</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>No maintenance costs are modeled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>O &amp; M Frequency (whole years).</td>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>Maintenance costs would be incurred annually (if there were any).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></p>
<p>In this example there is just one baseline construction, but often the baseline model will contain multiple constructions that need costing. This can be accomplished by adding multiple always run measures; with each one addressing a particular construction in the baseline model. The final task is to add the "<strong>Replace Exterior Window Constructions</strong>" measure using the "Window B" construction instead of "Window A". This measure will identify the alternate window construction to use as well as the cost for this construction:</p>
<p>Table 1.4: Replace Exterior Window Constructions
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Argument</th>
  <th>Value</th>
  <th>Note</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Pick a Window Construction From the Model to Replace Existing Window Constructions.</td>
  <td>Window B</td>
  <td>Name of the alternate construction to use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Change Fixed Windows?</td>
  <td>True</td>
  <td>Use this alternate construction for exterior fixed windows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Change Operable Windows?</td>
  <td>True</td>
  <td>Use this alternate construction for exterior operable windows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Remove Existing Costs?</td>
  <td>True</td>
  <td>Remove any costs previously associated with this construction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Material and Installation Costs for Construction per Area Used ($/ft^2).</td>
  <td>10</td>
  <td>Estimated cost for the alternate windows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Demolition Costs for Construction per Area Used ($/ft^2).</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>No demolition costs are modeled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Years Until Costs Start (whole years).</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>Construction costs will be incurred in year 0.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Demolition Costs Occur During Initial Construction?</td>
  <td>False</td>
  <td>No demolition required for new construction.</td>

<tr>
  <td>Expected Life (whole years).</td>
  <td>30</td>
  <td>The windows are expected to last for 30 years after installation. This will be beyond the analysis period.</td>

<tr>
  <td>O &amp; M Costs for Construction per Area Used ($/ft^2).</td>
  <td>0</td>

<h4 id="output">Output:</h4>
<p>Assuming that there are 100 ft^2 of exterior windows in the model the following cash flows will be generated for the two cases:</p>

<h3 id="case-2-replace-exterior-window-constructions-retrofit-construction">Case 2 - Replace Exterior Window Constructions, Retrofit Construction</h3>
<h4 id="narrative_1">Narrative:</h4>
<p>In this example a retrofit project is considering replacing the existing code minimum windows ("Window A") with a higher performance window construction ("Window B"). The window retrofit is motivated because the existing windows are nearing the end of their life. In the baseline case the current windows are assumed to be replaced by windows with the same energy performance in 5 years. The energy modeler has created a baseline model which includes both constructions. All windows in the baseline model reference "Window A"; "Window B" is not referenced by any windows in the baseline model. The energy modeler has received inputs from the cost estimator that "Window A" type windows will cost around $8/ft^2 and the "Window B" type windows will cost around $10/ft^2. Demolition of the existing windows will be around $3/ft^2 and the existing windows will have a salvage value of $1/ft^2. Discount factors will be applied to the constant dollar cash flows when computing metrics such as net present value.</p>
<h4 id="inputs_1">Inputs:</h4>
<p>As in case 1, the energy modeler sets the analysis period length using "<strong>Set Lifecycle Cost Parameters</strong>" as an always run measure and the utility rates using "<strong>Xcel EDA Tariff Selection and Model Setup</strong>" as an always run measure. The next task is to add the cost of the "Window A" construction in the baseline model. This cost will be input by adding "<strong>Add Cost per Area to Construction</strong>" as an always run measure to the simulation workflow with the following inputs:</p>

<p>The final task is to add the "<strong>Replace Exterior Window Constructions</strong>" measure using the "Window B" construction instead of "Window A". This measure will identify the alternate window construction to use as well as the cost for this construction. In this case the existing windows will be demolished and new windows installed in year 0. Therefore, the demolition costs for this measure will be set to match the costs modeled for the baseline case:</p>

<h4 id="narrative_2">Narrative:</h4>
<p>In this example a new construction project is considering replacing CFL light bulbs in the baseline model with higher performance LED light bulbs. The lighting change is partially motivated because the LED light bulbs have an expected life of 15 years instead of 3 years for the CFLs. The energy modeler has created a baseline model which includes a lighting definition ("Baseline Lighting") that represents the baseline CFLs. The energy modeler estimates that lighting power can be reduced by 30% by moving from CFL to LED light bulbs. The energy modeler has received inputs from the cost estimator that CFL light bulbs will cost around $4/ft^2 and the LED bulbs will cost around $10/ft^2 (150% more than the CFL price). Because the cost for fixtures will be the same in both the baseline and alternate cases, the energy modeler will not include costs for fixtures in the models.</p>

<h3 id="case-5-add-daylight-sensors-new-construction">Case 5 - Add Daylight Sensors, New Construction</h3>
<h4 id="narrative_4">Narrative:</h4>
<p>In this final example a new construction project is considering adding daylight controls to the baseline model. The energy modeler has created a baseline model which does not include daylight controls. The energy modeler has received inputs from the cost estimator that daylight controls will cost around $500/sensor and have an expected life of 30 years.</p>
<h4 id="inputs_4">Inputs:</h4>
<p>As in case 1, the energy modeler sets the analysis period length using "<strong>Set Lifecycle Cost Parameters</strong>" as an always run measure and the utility rates using "<strong>Xcel EDA Tariff Selection and Model Setup</strong>" as an always run measure. However, because there are no daylight control sensors in the baseline model there is no need to apply an always run measure to add costs to the baseline model. The final task is to add the "<strong>Add Daylight Sensors</strong>" measure. This measure will add daylight controls to each office space as well as their associated costs:</p>
