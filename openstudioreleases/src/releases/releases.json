    "body": "## OpenStudio Application Version 1.7.1\r\n\r\nThe [OpenStudio Coalition](https://openstudiocoalition.org/) is proud to announce the releases of [OpenStudio Application v1.7.1](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/releases/tag/v1.7.1). This is a patch release based on [OpenStudio SDK v3.7.0](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/releases/tag/v3.7.0) which uses [EnergyPlus v23.2.0](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v23.2.0).\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\nThe OpenStudio Application 1.7.1 release fixes several important bugs that were present in the 1.7.0 release.\r\n\r\nThe OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in are funded by the OpenStudio Coalition members [The Energy Coalition](https://energycoalition.org/), [PSD](https://psdconsulting.com/), [VEIC](https://www.veic.org/), and [EffiBEM](https://www.effibem.com/). The OpenStudio Coalition has a strategic roadmap (here are the [high level results](https://openstudiocoalition.org/about/roadmap/)) which prioritizes education and outreach to states, utilities, and higher education while ensuring the OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in user interfaces continue to be free and open source. To continue our efforts and provide additional support or training, [please join us](https://openstudiocoalition.org/about/openstudio_coalition/)!\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes:\r\n\r\n- BCL Viewer Human Readable Descriptions by @jmarrec in [#672](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/697)\r\n- Dragging construction set from library is very slow by @macumber in https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/issues/687\r\n- Unable to edit Water Use Equipment Definition by @macumber in https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/685\r\n- OpenStudio Application unusable on MacOS14 with M2 by https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/692\r\n- Error when running Create Typical Building from Model Measures by @jmarrec and @macumber in https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/699\r\n- Local copy of BCL folder gets wiped/overwritten by @macumber in https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/700\r\n\r\n### Internal/Developer changes:\r\n\r\n- Mac CI failing on GMP by @macumber in https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/690\r\n\r\n### Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nOpenStudio Application v1.7.1 is supported on 64-bit Windows 10 â€“ 11, OS X 11.0 and higher for x86, OS X 12.1 and higher on M1, Ubuntu 20.04, and Ubuntu 22.04. The OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in v1.7.0 requires SketchUp 2021 or higher. Refer to the [OpenStudio Application Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/wiki/OpenStudio-Application-Version-Compatibility-Matrix#openstudio-application-version-compatibility-matrix) and the [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/wiki/OpenStudio-SketchUp-Plug-in-Wiki#openstudio-sketchup-plug-in-version-compatibility-matrix) for more information.\r\n\r\n- Download and run the correct [OpenStudio Application v1.7.1](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/releases/tag/v1.7.1) installer for your platform. Select components for installation. Note that OpenStudio Application is a standalone app and does not require you to install OpenStudio SDK.\r\n- (Optional) Download the [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in v1.7.0](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/releases/tag/v1.7.0) RBZ package. Launch SketchUp 2021 or higher and install the RBZ package.\r\n- New - The new GitHub based Building Component Library (BCL) no longer requires an account to access online building components and measures! \r\n- Note that the Mac installers are currently not signed by the OpenStudio Coalition. To run these installers, the user must [ctrl-click the file and select open](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac). Additionally, Mac OS may add a quarantine attribute to the dmg file that prevents it from opening.  This attribute can be removed using the command [`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`](https://hiringengineersbook.com/post/disable-quarantine/) at the command line.\r\n- Note that the current version of SketchUp 2023 (Version 23.1.341) on Mac is currently affected by [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in crashes on launch on Mac (x86_64 and ARM) with SketchUp 2023 #133](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/issues/133). For Mac users, it is advised to use SketchUp 2022 with the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in until this issue is resolved.\r\n- Note that [PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) and [DView](https://beopt.nrel.gov/downloadDView.) are not included in either the SDK or Application installers. You will need to install PAT separately which is distributed on the [OpenStudio-PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) GitHub page and DView at the [Dview home page](https://beopt.nrel.gov/downloadDView).\r\nInstallation Notes\r\n\r\nFor help with common installation problems and more detailed instructions please visit, https://openstudiocoalition.org/getting_started/getting_started/.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n**Date Range: 2024-02-01** (v1.7.0) -

These releases are based on [OpenStudio SDK v3.7.0](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/releases/tag/v3.7.0) which uses [EnergyPlus v23.2.0](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v23.2.0).\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\nThe OpenStudio Application 1.7.0 release updates the application to OpenStudio 3.7.0, EnergyPlus 23.2.0.  This version of the OpenStudio Application is the first version to allow access to Python Measures now supported by the OpenStudio SDK.  This functionality allows users to create and use Python Measures in OpenStudio Workflows. Opening the door to the measure writing world for Python expands the potential for users to automate and augment their workflows. If you make something amazing, please share it at https://bcl.nrel.gov/! \r\n\r\nThe OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in are funded by the OpenStudio Coalition members [The Energy Coalition](https://energycoalition.org/), [PSD](https://psdconsulting.com/), [VEIC](https://www.veic.org/), and [EffiBEM](https://www.effibem.com/). The OpenStudio Coalition has a strategic roadmap (here are the [high level results](https://openstudiocoalition.org/about/roadmap/)) which prioritizes education and outreach to states, utilities, and higher education while ensuring the OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in user interfaces continue to be free and open source. To continue our efforts and provide additional support or training, [please join us](https://openstudiocoalition.org/about/openstudio_coalition/)!\r\n\r\n### New Features:\r\n\r\n- Update to OpenStudio SDK v3.7.0 and EnergyPlus v23.2.0  by [@jmarrec](https://github.com/jmarrec) in [#627](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/627)\r\n- Updated the Qt dependency from 6.3.0 to 6.6.1 by [@macumber](https://github.com/macumber) in [#650](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/650).\r\n- A new option to create and run Python measures has been added to the OpenStudio Application by [@jmarrec](https://github.com/jmarrec) in [#651](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/651). \r\n    -

The OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in v1.7.0 requires SketchUp 2021 or higher. Refer to the [OpenStudio Application Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/wiki/OpenStudio-Application-Version-Compatibility-Matrix#openstudio-application-version-compatibility-matrix) and the [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/wiki/OpenStudio-SketchUp-Plug-in-Wiki#openstudio-sketchup-plug-in-version-compatibility-matrix) for more information.\r\n\r\n- Download and run the correct [OpenStudio Application v1.7.0](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/releases/tag/v1.7.0) installer for your platform. Select components for installation. Note that OpenStudio Application is a standalone app and does not require you to install OpenStudio SDK.\r\n- (Optional) Download the [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in v1.7.0](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/releases/tag/v1.7.0) RBZ package. Launch SketchUp 2021 or higher and install the RBZ package.\r\n- New - The new GitHub based Building Component Library (BCL) no longer requires an account to access online building components and measures! \r\n- Note that the Mac installers are currently not signed by the OpenStudio Coalition. To run these installers, the user must [ctrl-click the file and select open](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac). Additionally, Mac OS may add a quarantine attribute to the dmg file that prevents it from opening.  This attribute can be removed using the command [`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`](https://hiringengineersbook.com/post/disable-quarantine/) at the command line.\r\n- Note that the current version of SketchUp 2023 (Version 23.1.341) on Mac is currently affected by [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in crashes on launch on Mac (x86_64 and ARM) with SketchUp 2023 #133](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/issues/133).

    "body": "# OpenStudio Application Version 1.2.0 and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in Version 1.2.0\r\n\r\n*Release Notes - 2021-06-08*\r\n\r\nThe [OpenStudio Coalition](https://openstudiocoalition.org/) is proud to announce the releases of [OpenStudio Application v1.2.0](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/releases/tag/v1.2.0) and [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in v1.2.0](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/releases/tag/v1.2.0). These releases are based on [OpenStudio SDK v3.2.0](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/releases/tag/v3.2.0) which uses [EnergyPlus v9.5.0](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v9.5.0).\r\n\r\n# Overview\r\n\r\nFollowing an important announcement related to future development of the OpenStudio Application released in September 2019 ([A Shift in BTOâ€™s BEM Strategy: A New Future for the OpenStudio Application](https://www.openstudio.net/new-future-for-openstudio-application)), this release marks the second major release of the OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in by the OpenStudio Coalition.\r\nGoing forward, the OpenStudio SDK will continue to be distributed and released by NREL and U.S. DOE two times per year, in April and October. The OpenStudio SDK includes the C++ SDK, Ruby API, Command Line Interface (CLI), OpenStudio Standards, and integrated EnergyPlus and Radiance packages. \r\n\r\nThe OpenStudio Coalition will be distributing and releasing new versions of the OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in as new versions of the OpenStudio SDK are released. Development of the OpenStudio Application has moved to [openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication) and development of the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in has moved to [openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin).\r\n \r\nOpenStudio Application Version 1.2.0 and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in Version 1.2.0 are the second major releases of these programs distributed by the OpenStudio Coalition. Notable changes include:\r\n\r\n- **Update to OpenStudio SDK v3.2.0 and EnergyPlus v9.5.0**\r\n- **Update to Ruby 2.7.2 for compatibility with SketchUp 2021**\r\n    - OpenStudio Application v1.2.0 is compatible with SketchUp 2021\r\n    - OpenStudio Application v1.1.0 is compatible with SketchUp 2019-2020\r\n- **Improvements to GridView performance for larger models**\r\n    - Displaying the Surfaces tab for example is now 3 times faster\r\n- Add support for ZoneHVAC:CoolingPanel:RadiantConvective:Water, Humidifier:Stream:Gas, Fan:ComponentModel, Output:Diagnostics, and Output:Table:SummaryReports objects\r\n- Fix installer and geometry tab on Ubuntu\r\n- Add ability to start app on specific tab using the `OPENSTUDIO_APPLICATION_START_TAB_INDEX` environment variable (Feature supported by Ladybug Tools)\r\n- Updated FloorspaceJS to latest version, and ThreeJS to version r98\r\n- Update to supported JFrog and NREL conan remotes\r\n\r\nNote that [PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) and [DView](https://beopt.nrel.gov/downloadDView) are not included in either the SDK or Application installers. You will need to install PAT separately which is distributed on the [OpenStudio-PAT GitHub page](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) and DView at the [Dview home page](https://beopt.nrel.gov/downloadDView).\r\n\r\n#  Installation Notes\r\n\r\nOpenStudio Application v1.2.0 is supported on 64-bit Windows 7 â€“ 10, OS X 10.12 â€“ 10.15, Ubuntu 18.04, and Ubuntu 20.04. The OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in v1.2.0 requires OpenStudio Application v1.2.0 and SketchUp 2021. \r\n\r\nRefer to the [OpenStudio Application Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/wiki/OpenStudio-Application-Version-Compatibility-Matrix) and the [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/wiki/OpenStudio-SketchUp-Plug-in-Wiki) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Installation Steps\r\n\r\n- Download and run the correct [OpenStudio Application v1.2.0 installer](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/releases/tag/v1.2.0) for your platform. Select components for installation. Note that OpenStudio Application is a standalone app and does not require you to install OpenStudio SDK.\r\n- (Optional) Download the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in v1.2.0 RBZ package. Launch SketchUp 2021 and install the RBZ package.\r\n- (Optional) Setup a Building Component Library (BCL) account to access online building components and measures. \r\n\r\nFor help with common

    "body": "# OpenStudio Application Version 1.1.0 \r\n\r\nThe [OpenStudio Coalition](https://openstudiocoalition.org/) is proud to announce the releases of [OpenStudio Application v1.1.0](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/releases/tag/v1.1.0) and [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in v1.1.0](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/releases/tag/v1.1.0). These releases are based on [OpenStudio SDK v3.1.0](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/releases/tag/v3.1.0) which uses [EnergyPlus v.9.4.0](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v9.4.0).\r\n\r\n# Overview\r\n\r\nFollowing an important announcement related to future development of the OpenStudio Application released in September 2019 ([A Shift in BTOâ€™s BEM Strategy: A New Future for the OpenStudio Application](https://www.openstudio.net/new-future-for-openstudio-application)), this release marks the first major release of the OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in by the OpenStudio Coalition.\r\nGoing forward, the OpenStudio SDK will continue to be distributed and released by NREL and U.S. DOE two times per year, in April and October. The OpenStudio SDK includes the C++ SDK, Ruby API, Command Line Interface (CLI), OpenStudio Standards, and integrated EnergyPlus and Radiance packages. \r\n\r\nThe OpenStudio Coalition will be distributing and releasing new versions of the OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in as new versions of the OpenStudio SDK are released. Development of the OpenStudio Application has moved to [https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication) and development of the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in has moved to [https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin).\r\n \r\nOpenStudio Application Version 1.1.0 and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in Version 1.1.0 are the first major releases of these programs distributed by the OpenStudio Coalition. Notable changes include:\r\n\r\n- Update to OpenStudio SDK v3.1.0 and EnergyPlus v9.4\r\n- Update to QT 5.15 LTS\r\n- Add Continuous Integration to OpenStudio Application repo\r\n- Add support for WaterCooled VRFs in OpenStudio Application\r\n- Add new fields for SimulationControl: \r\n    - DoHVACSizingSimulationforSizingPeriods\r\n    - MaximumNumberofHVACSizingSimulationPasses\r\n- Add OutputJSON to the OpenStudioApplication\r\n- Add ability to edit Schedule Set Name from Space Types tab\r\n- Add check for update to the OpenStudio Application\r\n- Fix crash on save when directory is open in Explorer on Windows\r\n- Fix bugs related to north angle in geometry preview tab\r\n- Fix startup dialog bugs in OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in\r\n\r\nNote that [PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) and [DView](https://beopt.nrel.gov/downloadDView) are not included in either the SDK or Application installers. You will need to install PAT separately which is distributed on the [OpenStudio-PAT GitHub page](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) and DView at the [Dview home page](https://beopt.nrel.gov/downloadDView).\r\n\r\n#  Installation Notes\r\n\r\nOpenStudio Application v1.1.0 is supported on 64-bit Windows 7 â€“ 10, OS X 10.12 â€“ 10.15, and Ubuntu 18.04. The OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in v1.1.0 requires OpenStudio Application v1.1.0 and SketchUp 2019 - 2020. Refer to the [OpenStudio Application Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/wiki/OpenStudio-Application-Version-Compatibility-Matrix) and the [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/wiki/OpenStudio-SketchUp-Plug-in-Wiki) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Installation Steps\r\n\r\n- Download and run the correct OpenStudio Application v1.1.0 installer for your platform. Select components for installation.

You will need to install PAT separately which is distributed on the [OpenStudio-PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) GitHub page and DView at the [Dview home page]( https://beopt.nrel.gov/downloadDView).\r\n\r\n# Where to Find OpenStudio Documentation\r\n\r\n- OpenStudio release documentation, including these release notes, tutorials, and other user documentation, is available at [https://www.openstudio.net/](https://www.openstudio.net/.)\r\n- C++ API documentation is available at [https://openstudio-sdk-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html](https://openstudio-sdk-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)\r\n- OpenStudio Application Developer docs at [https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudioApplication/wiki](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudioApplication/wiki)\r\n- OpenStudio Application User docs at [https://nrel.github.io/OpenStudioApplication/](https://nrel.github.io/OpenStudioApplication/)\r\n- Measure development documentation is available at [http://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/reference/measure_writing_guide/](http://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/reference/measure_writing_guide/ )\r\n- A roadmap for planned features is available at http://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/getting_started/roadmap/.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation Notes\r\n\r\nOpenStudio Application 1.0.0 is supported on 64-bit Windows 7 â€“ 10, OS X 10.12 â€“ 10.15, and Ubuntu 18.04.\r\n\r\nOpenStudio Application 1.0.0 supports [EnergyPlus Release 9.3](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v9.3.0), which is bundled with the OpenStudio installer. \r\n\r\nOpenStudio Application 1.0.0 supports Radiance 5.0.a.12, which is bundled with the OpenStudio installer; users no longer must install Radiance separately, and OpenStudio will use the included Radiance version regardless of any other versions that may be installed on the system. \r\n\r\nOpenStudio Application 1.0.0 now uses **Ruby 2.5.5** as the supported version (2.2.4 previously).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation Steps\r\n\r\n- Download and install [OpenStudioApplication](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudioApplication/). Select components for installation. Note that OpenStudio Application is a standalone app and does not require you to install OpenStudio SDK.\r\n- Setup a Building Component Library (BCL) account to access online building components and measures. View instructions on how to setup your account and configure the key in OpenStudio.\r\n- The [OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-sketchup-plugin) requires SketchUp 2019 (not available for Linux). The OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plug-in does not support older versions of SketchUp. SketchUp must be installed before OpenStudio Application to automatically activate the plugin. If you install SketchUp after OpenStudio Application, simply rerun the OpenStudio Application installer. Please see the installation guide on [OpenStudio Application SketchUp Plugin](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-sketchup-plugin). \r\n\r\n# OpenStudio Application: Changelog\r\n\r\nThe 1.0.0 is a major release\r\nThe 1.0.0 release updates OpenStudio SDK to 3.0.0 and to use EnergyPlus 9.3.
