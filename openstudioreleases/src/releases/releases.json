    "body": "Following an important announcement related to future development of the OpenStudio Application released in September 2019 ([A Shift in BTO’s BEM Strategy: A New Future for the OpenStudio Application](https://www.openstudio.net/new-future-for-openstudio-application)), this release marks the fourth major release of the OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in by the OpenStudio Coalition.\r\n\r\nThe OpenStudio Application 1.8.0 release updates the application to OpenStudio 3.8.0, EnergyPlus 24.1.0.  This version of the OpenStudio SDK updates the version of the embedded Ruby interpreter from 2.7.2 to 3.2.2.  This allows OpenStudio Application 1.8.0 to be compatible with the embedded Ruby interpreter in SketchUp 2024.\r\n\r\nThe OpenStudio SDK update to 3.8.0 was not backwards compatible with many measures on the BCL. This release updates the OpenStudio Application to be compatible with the newest released versions of these measures.\r\n\r\nThe OpenStudio Application 1.8.0 installers are hosted on GitHub as well as a new member’s only section of the https://openstudiocoalition.org/ website.  This new section will provide a secure location to download installers in future releases.  Create an account, give it a try, and let us know what you think!\r\n\r\nThe OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in are funded by the OpenStudio Coalition members [The Energy Coalition](https://energycoalition.org/), [PSD](https://psdconsulting.com/), [VEIC](https://www.veic.org/), and [EffiBEM](https://www.effibem.com/). The OpenStudio Coalition has a strategic roadmap (here are the [high level results](https://openstudiocoalition.org/about/roadmap/)) which prioritizes education and outreach to states, utilities, and higher education while ensuring the OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in user interfaces continue to be free and open source. To continue our efforts and provide additional support or training, [please join us](https://openstudiocoalition.org/about/openstudio_coalition/)!\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Conan v2 + OS SDK

    "body": "## OpenStudio Application Version 1.7.1\r\n\r\nThe [OpenStudio Coalition](https://openstudiocoalition.org/) is proud to announce the releases of [OpenStudio Application v1.7.1](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/releases/tag/v1.7.1). This is a patch release based on [OpenStudio SDK v3.7.0](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/releases/tag/v3.7.0) which uses [EnergyPlus v23.2.0](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v23.2.0).\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\nThe OpenStudio Application 1.7.1 release fixes several important bugs that were present in the 1.7.0 release.\r\n\r\nThe OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in are funded by the OpenStudio Coalition members [The Energy Coalition](https://energycoalition.org/), [PSD](https://psdconsulting.com/), [VEIC](https://www.veic.org/), and [EffiBEM](https://www.effibem.com/). The OpenStudio Coalition has a strategic roadmap (here are the [high level results](https://openstudiocoalition.org/about/roadmap/)) which prioritizes education and outreach to states, utilities, and higher education while ensuring the OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in user interfaces continue to be free and open source. To continue our efforts and provide additional support or training, [please join us](https://openstudiocoalition.org/about/openstudio_coalition/)!\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes:\r\n\r\n- BCL Viewer Human Readable Descriptions by [@jmarrec](https://github.com/jmarrec) in [#672](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/697)\r\n- Dragging construction set from library is very slow by [@macumber](https://github.com/macumber) in https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/issues/687\r\n- Unable to edit Water Use Equipment Definition by [@macumber](https://github.com/macumber) in [#685](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/685)\r\n- OpenStudio Application unusable on MacOS14 with M2 by https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/692\r\n- Error when running Create Typical Building from Model Measures by [@jmarrec](https://github.com/jmarrec) and @macumber in [#699](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/699)\r\n- Local copy of BCL folder gets wiped/overwritten by [@macumber](https://github.com/macumber) in [#700](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/700)\r\n\r\n### Internal/Developer changes:\r\n\r\n- Mac CI failing on GMP by [@macumber](https://github.com/macumber) in [#690](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/690)\r\n\r\n### Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nOpenStudio Application v1.7.1 is supported on 64-bit Windows 10 – 11, OS X 11.0 and higher for x86, OS X 12.1 and higher on M1, Ubuntu 20.04, and Ubuntu 22.04. The OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in v1.7.0 requires SketchUp 2021 or higher. Refer to the [OpenStudio Application Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/wiki/OpenStudio-Application-Version-Compatibility-Matrix#openstudio-application-version-compatibility-matrix) and the [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/wiki/OpenStudio-SketchUp-Plug-in-Wiki#openstudio-sketchup-plug-in-version-compatibility-matrix) for more information.\r\n\r\n- Download and run the correct [OpenStudio Application v1.7.1](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/releases/tag/v1.7.1) installer for your platform. Select components for installation. Note that OpenStudio Application is a standalone app and does not require you to install OpenStudio SDK.\r\n- (Optional) Download the [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in v1.7.0](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/releases/tag/v1.7.0) RBZ package. Launch SketchUp 2021 or higher and install the RBZ package.\r\n- New - The new GitHub based Building Component Library (BCL) no longer requires an account to access online building components and measures! \r\n- Note that the Mac installers are currently not signed by the OpenStudio Coalition. To run these installers, the user must [ctrl-click the file and select open](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac). Additionally, Mac OS may add a quarantine attribute to the dmg file that prevents it from opening.  This attribute can be removed using the command [`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`](https://hiringengineersbook.com/post/disable-quarantine/) at the command line.\r\n- Note that the current version of SketchUp 2023 (Version 23.1.341) on Mac is currently affected by [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in crashes on launch on Mac (x86_64 and ARM) with SketchUp 2023 #133](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/issues/133). For Mac users, it is advised to use SketchUp 2022 with the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in until this issue is resolved.\r\n- Note that [PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) and [DView](https://beopt.nrel.gov/downloadDView.) are not included in either the SDK or Application installers.

    "body": "## OpenStudio Application Version 1.7.0\r\n\r\nThe [OpenStudio Coalition](https://openstudiocoalition.org/) is proud to announce the releases of [OpenStudio Application v1.7.0](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/releases/tag/v1.7.0) and [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in v1.7.0](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/releases/tag/v1.7.0). These releases are based on [OpenStudio SDK v3.7.0](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/releases/tag/v3.7.0) which uses [EnergyPlus v23.2.0](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v23.2.0).\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\nThe OpenStudio Application 1.7.0 release updates the application to OpenStudio 3.7.0, EnergyPlus 23.2.0.  This version of the OpenStudio Application is the first version to allow access to Python Measures now supported by the OpenStudio SDK.  This functionality allows users to create and use Python Measures in OpenStudio Workflows. Opening the door to the measure writing world for Python expands the potential for users to automate and augment their workflows. If you make something amazing, please share it at https://bcl.nrel.gov/! \r\n\r\nThe OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in are funded by the OpenStudio Coalition members [The Energy Coalition](https://energycoalition.org/), [PSD](https://psdconsulting.com/), [VEIC](https://www.veic.org/), and [EffiBEM](https://www.effibem.com/). The OpenStudio Coalition has a strategic roadmap (here are the [high level results](https://openstudiocoalition.org/about/roadmap/)) which prioritizes education and outreach to states, utilities, and higher education while ensuring the OpenStudio Application and OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in user interfaces continue to be free and open source. To continue our efforts and provide additional support or training, [please join us](https://openstudiocoalition.org/about/openstudio_coalition/)!\r\n\r\n### New Features:\r\n\r\n- Update to OpenStudio SDK v3.7.0 and EnergyPlus v23.2.0  by [@jmarrec](https://github.com/jmarrec) in [#627](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/627)\r\n- Updated the Qt dependency from 6.3.0 to 6.6.1 by [@macumber](https://github.com/macumber) in [#650](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/650).\r\n- A new option to create and run Python measures has been added to the OpenStudio Application by [@jmarrec](https://github.com/jmarrec) in [#651](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/pull/651). \r\n    -

The OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in v1.7.0 requires SketchUp 2021 or higher. Refer to the [OpenStudio Application Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/wiki/OpenStudio-Application-Version-Compatibility-Matrix#openstudio-application-version-compatibility-matrix) and the [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/wiki/OpenStudio-SketchUp-Plug-in-Wiki#openstudio-sketchup-plug-in-version-compatibility-matrix) for more information.\r\n\r\n- Download and run the correct [OpenStudio Application v1.7.0](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/releases/tag/v1.7.0) installer for your platform. Select components for installation. Note that OpenStudio Application is a standalone app and does not require you to install OpenStudio SDK.\r\n- (Optional) Download the [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in v1.7.0](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/releases/tag/v1.7.0) RBZ package. Launch SketchUp 2021 or higher and install the RBZ package.\r\n- New - The new GitHub based Building Component Library (BCL) no longer requires an account to access online building components and measures! \r\n- Note that the Mac installers are currently not signed by the OpenStudio Coalition. To run these installers, the user must [ctrl-click the file and select open](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac). Additionally, Mac OS may add a quarantine attribute to the dmg file that prevents it from opening.  This attribute can be removed using the command [`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`](https://hiringengineersbook.com/post/disable-quarantine/) at the command line.\r\n- Note that the current version of SketchUp 2023 (Version 23.1.341) on Mac is currently affected by [OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in crashes on launch on Mac (x86_64 and ARM) with SketchUp 2023 #133](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin/issues/133). For Mac users, it is advised to use SketchUp 2022 with the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in until this issue is resolved.\r\n- Note that [PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) and [DView](https://beopt.nrel.gov/downloadDView.) are not included in either the SDK or Application installers. You will need to install PAT separately which is distributed on the [OpenStudio-PAT](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-PAT) GitHub page and DView at the [Dview home page](https://beopt.nrel.gov/downloadDView).\r\nInstallation Notes\r\n\r\nFor help with common installation problems and more detailed instructions please visit, https://openstudiocoalition.org/getting_started/getting_started/.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nFull Changelog: [v1.6.0...v1.7.0](https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/OpenStudioApplication/compare/v1.6.0...v1.7.0)\r\n\r\n**Date Range: 2023-06-06** (v1.6.0) -
