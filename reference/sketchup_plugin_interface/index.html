<h4 id="new-openstudio-model">New OpenStudio Model</h4>
<p>This tool closes your current OpenStudio model and creates a new one. On a Mac it creates an empty model and you have to go under the menu item <strong>Extentions/OpenStudio User Scripts/On-Demand Template Generators/Space Type and Construction Set Wizard</strong> to add template items like constructions, schedules, and space types. On a PC the template dialog will be available once and you can choose templates. If you want to add additional template types you must go to the <strong>Extentions/OpenStudio User Scripts/On-Demand Template Generators/Space Type and Construction Set Wizard</strong>. </td>

<h4 id="open-openstudio-model">Open OpenStudio Model</h4>
<p>Use this feature to close your current OpenStudio model and open an OpenStudio file (.osm). It does not close your current SketchUp file, but loads a different OpenStudio model into it. OpenStudio 0.6.0 introduced an updated OSM format. It will not open OSM files created with OpenStudio 0.4.4 or earlier, and may not open some files created with OpenStudio 0.5.0.</td>

<td><img alt="Save OpenStudio Model Icon" src="../../img/plugin_reference_guide/OSSave-24_0.png" /></td>

<h4 id="save-openstudio-model">Save OpenStudio Model</h4>
<p>Saves your OpenStudio Model as an OpenStudio file (.osm). If you save your OSM file and then save your SketchUp model, the SketchUp model will maintain a link to the OSM model. If you close and reopen your linked SketchUp file (.skp), it will reload the content from the OSM file. All the energy model content is saved in the OSM file, not in the SketchUp file.</p>
<p>The benefit of having a link to a SketchUp file is to maintain a relationship with non-OpenStudio content that you may have in your model, such as a base plan or base model. A linked SketchUp file also has saved scenes, drawing styles, and section cut location. When saving your OpenStudio model, make sure your filename ends with the ".osm" extension. If it does not have that extension, OpenStudio will not open the file. If you have files without this extension, you can manually rename them; they should open.</td>

<h4 id="save-as-openstudio-model">Save As OpenStudio Model</h4>
<p>Using this feature saves your OpenStudio model as a new OSM file and updates the SketchUp file to link to the newly saved OSM file.</p>
<p>When saving your OpenStudio model, make sure your filename ends with the ".osm" extension. If it does not have this extension, OpenStudio will not open the file. If you have files without this extension, you can manually rename them; they should open.

<td></p>
<h4 id="import-energyplus-input-data-file-idf">Import EnergyPlus Input Data File (IDF)</h4>
<p>This feature functions similarly to the Import OpenStudio Model tool. If you import an entire IDF model, your current OSM model is closed and a new one is created from your IDF. When you import and then save an IDF model, you will be prompted to save it as an OSM file. If you want to keep it as an IDF file, you can choose the Export EnergyPlus Input Data File tool instead of the Save OSM tool. If you have added geometry or other objects, such as interior partitions that are unique to an OpenStudio model, you will lose or alter those objects when you export back to an IDF file.</p>
<p>Like the Import OpenStudio Model tool, the Import EnergyPlus Input Data File tool can be used to import additional content into your model. In this import workflow, your OSM model stays open and the import tool adds additional content from a previously saved IDF file.</p>
<p>Content types that can be imported from an IDF file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constructions (including materials)</li>
<li>Schedules</li>
</ul>
<p>You can access these features under the Plugins/OpenStudio menu or the <code>File-&gt;Import</code> menu. <em>Space Loads</em> are unique to an OSM, so they cannot be imported from an IDF file.</p>
<p><img alt="Import Dialog" src="../../img/plugin_reference_guide/OpenStudioImportMenu_0.png" /></p>
<p><em>Above: Import dialog allows you to import OpenStudio models, constructions, schedules, and space loads. You can also import IDF files through this menu.</em>

</td>

<h4 id="export-energyplus-input-data-file">Export EnergyPlus Input Data File</h4>
<p>Use this tool when exporting an IDF file from an OSM model. This can be useful if you need an IDF file to use in an application that does not support the new OSM format. Some model data may be lost when exporting to an IDF because the OSM file format supports many objects, such as interior partition groups and surfaces, that are not in EnergyPlus. If you export an OSM model with unsupported elements to an IDF file, and then reimport it into OpenStudio, the unsupported elements will be gone.</p>
<p>Good practice for a typical workflow is to always use your OSM file as the working file. You can run simulations in EnergyPlus directly from an OSM file by using the OpenStudio RunManager application as a stand-alone application or through the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in interface.</p>
<p>When exploring an IDF file, make sure your file name ends with the ".idf" extension. If it does not have this extension, EnergyPlus and other applications may not open the file. If you have files without this extension, you can manually rename them; they should open.

<p>This tool can function similarly to the Open OpenStudio Model tool. If you import an entire model, your current model is closed and a new one loaded. When you import an OSM model and then save the OSM model, you will be prompted for a new filename. This prevents you from accidentally overwriting your original file.</p>
<p>The Import OpenStudio Model tool can also be used to import additional content into your model. In this import workflow, your OSM model stays open and the import tool adds content from a previously saved OSM file (see the Import dialog image above.) Content types that can be imported from an OSM file follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constructions (including construction sets, constructions, and materials)</li>
<li>Schedules</li>
<li>Space loads

<p>There is no toolbar icon to use for importing gbXML (Green Building XML) files; this functionality is available through the <code>Plugins-&gt;OpenStudio-&gt;Import-&gt;Import gbXML Model</code> menu item only. If you import a gbXML model, your current OSM model is closed and a new one is created from your gbXML. When you import a gbXML model and then save the model, you will be prompted to save it as an OSM file. Currently, there is no export of gbXML from OpenStudio.</p>

<h4 id="export-untranslated-energyplus-idf">Export Untranslated EnergyPlus IDF</h4>
<p>When an IDF file is imported into the SketchUp Plug-in, a translation between EnergyPlus IDF and OpenStudio OSM occurs. OpenStudio does not yet support translation of all objects from EnergyPlus IDF to OpenStudio OSM. To support users with workflows that switch between IDF and OSM, the SketchUp Plug-in allows users to export IDF objects that were not translated during the import. These objects are written to a plain text IDF file so the user may then reintegrate these untranslated objects with the IDF produced by the OpenStudio OSM to EnergyPlus IDF translation. After importing an EnergyPlus IDF, a prompt will alert the user about the objects that could not be translated to OpenStudio OSM.</p>

<p>The Space Diagram Tool allows you to use native SketchUp tools to draw a space diagram representing your building's floor plan. After drawing the diagram, you can select the surfaces and create a single-story or multistory building based on the diagram. Your model will have one space for each surface in your diagram for each floor. You can use this tool multiple times. If you want to create a new diagram with a unique floor for higher floors, just repeat the steps you used for the original diagram.</p>
<p>Surfaces that are not horizontal will be ignored; surfaces with improper surface normals will be flipped over. Once made, the spaces are like any other OpenStudio space. You can enter the space and alter or extend your geometry to refine it beyond the basic geometry created by the space diagram tool.</p>
<p><img alt="Space Diagram Dialog" src="../../img/plugin_reference_guide/width_SU_SpaceDigram_a.png" /></p>
<p><em>Above: Screenshot of Space Diagram Dialog Box</em></p>
<p>The following image shows the resulting model after using the Space Diagram Tool. The loose geometry of the diagram will be saved onto a layer in SketchUp named "OpenStudio - Space Diagrams". Although the resulting spaces are saved in your OpenStudio model (OSM file), the diagram is not. If you want to keep the diagram, you can save the SketchUp file as well. Even if you do not save the SketchUp file you will still have access to the diagram until you quit. If you want to make a change to the diagram, you can delete the spaces, alter the diagram, and re-project them.</p>

<h4 id="project-loose-geometry">Project Loose Geometry</h4>
<p>The Project Loose Geometry Tool allows you to use the native SketchUp tools to draw loose geometry onto surfaces of your building envelope. When you are ready to project these surfaces into the spaces of your model, you can open this tool and run it across all loose geometry or the selected loose geometry. Although this is often used to create fenestration, it can also be used to split a base surface into two base surfaces. For example, you can create a line 3 feet above the ground representing a change in construction from concrete block to brick. The advantage of this tool--versus the traditional method of entering and drawing within a space--is that you can quickly create surfaces across many spaces without having to ever enter those spaces.</p>
<p>If some of the surfaces you have selected are not in the same plane as a building surface, they will be ignored.</p>

<p>The OpenStudio Inspector displays information about your currently open OpenStudio model. This replaces the Object Information Window found in older versions.</p>
<p>The Inspector Window is divided into three main areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>The top left is the "Select Type" pane. This has a partial list of OpenStudio object types and identifies how many objects of a specific type are in your model.</li>
<li>The bottom left pane is the "Select Object" pane. If you select a "Type" in the type pane, a list of objects of that type will be displayed in the "Select Object" pane. The objects listed in the "Select Object" pane have a number to indicate how many objects in the model refer to this object. Below the list are several buttons. The plus button to create a new object of this type, a copy button to copy the selected object, a minus button to delete the selected object, and a purge button to purge unused objects of this type. For some object types, one or more of these buttons may be disabled.</li>
<li>The third and last pane of the Inspector is the "Edit Object" pane at the right. This displays the fields for the currently selected object in the "Select Object" pane. Some fields accept a string; others are edited via a pull-down list. For some object types, some fields may be hidden from the Inspector or locked from editing. This is by design.</li>
</ol>
<p>OpenStudio 0.9.0 adds a render mode aware inspector. If you are in a render by class or render by boundary condition and use the SketchUp select tool to select a space, the OpenStudio space will be selected in the Inspector. If, however, you are in render by space type, thermal zone, or story mode, a space type, thermal zone, or story will be selected in the Inspector. This is assuming that the space is an assigned space type, thermal zone, or story. The construction render mode is similar, but you need to select a surface versus a space to select a construction object in the Inspector. Currently, if you select a thermal zone, space type, or construction object in the Inspector, it will not make a selection in the SketchUp model that correlates to this object.</p>
<p>The Inspector cannot select multiple objects at once. So if you select multiple spaces or surfaces in SketchUp, only one will be active in the Inspector. Similarly, you cannot use the Inspector to batch change the attributes for multiple objects at once.</p>
<p>The <a href="#set-space-attributes">Set Space Attributes for Selected Spaces</a> tool on the OpenStudio toolbar does allow batch changes for space objects, and to a limited extent for zones that parent the spaces.</p>

While surfaces are hidden you can also use SketchUp's built-in "View Hidden Geometry" to quickly view all hidden surfaces.</p>
<p>New to the Surface Search Tool with OpenStudio 0.5 and later is the ability to search based on Surface Orientation. You can set both "from" and "to" to a single value if you want to find surfaces that face a specific direction, or you can set unique values to show surfaces within a range of angles. The "Exclude Horizontal Surfaces" is generally intended to be used along with Surface Orientation search to hide surfaces with no azimuth. There are also check boxes to limit search results to non-convex surfaces or to surfaces with more than a set number of vertices. Once your search is complete, the resulting surfaces are selected in SketchUp. You can use this selection for other operations or scripts.</p>

<p>The Input File Errors and Warnings dialog automatically opens when there is an error or warning when opening or importing a file. Many common geometry errors (upside-down floor or roof, inside-out window, non-coplanar surfaces, etc.) are fixed automatically when you open the input file. This dialog will also report unsupported IDF objects on import.</p>

<h4 id="render-by-surface-type">Render by Surface Type</h4>
<p>The OpenStudio Render by Surface Type mode will render walls, roofs, windows, doors, floors, shading surfaces, and interior partition surfaces with unique colors. When you create new geometry, it will be automatically classified and rendered. If you try to assign a color yourself, the application will override you. You never need to use the paint bucket tool in this render mode.</p>
<p>If you set a surface construction to "Air Boundary," it will be rendered as a translucent checkerboard pattern. This construction is intended to represent thermal zone boundaries that do not represent physical walls in the building.</p>

<h4 id="render-by-outside-boundary-condition">Render by Outside Boundary Condition</h4>
<p>The OpenStudio Render by Outside Boundary Condition mode will render surfaces by their outside boundary conditions. Only space surfaces have boundary conditions, so only they will be rendered with a color. Shading and interior partition surfaces will be white. This is a good rendering mode to diagnose problems with your model. It provides a quick way to globally look at boundary conditions throughout your model. You never need to use the paint bucket tool in this render mode. In the screenshot below, a section cut has been drawn to reveal the inside of the model, making the boundary condition of surfaces easy to see.</p>

<p>The most common boundary conditions you will see are "Outdoors, Surface, and Ground", but there are actually 9 basic boundary modes, with a number of subsets within some conditions. For "Outdoors" there are also unique color variations to indicate if there is sun and or wind exposure. The following image shows the SketchUp materials for the various boundary conditions.</p>

<h4 id="render-by-construction">Render by Construction</h4>
<p>The OpenStudio Render by Construction mode renders surfaces by their construction. Although this seems similar to Render by Surface Type, there are a number of differences:</p>
<p>The Inspector Window is divided into three main areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Render by Construction mode, surfaces are rendered by their construction, so if two windows do not have the same construction they will not have the same render color. The same logic is applied to other surface types.</li>
<li>Shading surfaces and interior partitions can have constructions assigned. If they do have constructions, they will be rendered just as space surfaces are.</li>
<li>Construction properties of a surface can be applied directly to a surface, or they can be inherited from other objects (space, space type, story, or building). The first time you click the render by construction button, it shows hard assigned and inherited constructions. If you click it again, it shows only hard assigned constructions. Other surfaces do not have a render color. Clicking the render button again returns you to the default mode where hard assigned and inherited constructions are shown.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a note, this is not a render by material mode, so two constructions that have the same outside material, will have unique render colors. However, in this render mode you can set render color using either the SketchUp paint bucket or the Inspector. To use the Inspector, select the construction object and set the RGB values. These color settings are part of the OpenStudio model and will be maintained the next time you open the model.</p>

<h4 id="render-by-space-type">Render by Space Type</h4>
<p>The OpenStudio Render by Space Type mode renders each space based on the Space Type assigned to it. This is a two state button. The first time you click it, hard assigned and inherited space types are rendered. If you click it again, only hard assigned space types are given a render color. Space types can be assigned to a space or inherited from the building object. You can assign space types to a space by using the "Set Attributes for Selected Spaces" tool or the OpenStudio Inspector. The installed templates have preassigned colors for each space type, but you can use SketchUp's paint bucket tool or the OpenStudio Inspector to change the colors. These changes are saved as part of your OpenStudio model.</p>

<p>The OpenStudio Render by Thermal Zone mode renders each space based on the thermal zone assigned to it. You can assign a thermal zone to a space using the "Set Attributes for Selected Spaces" tool or the OpenStudio Inspector. When a new thermal zone is made, a color will be assigned to it. You can change that color using SketchUp's paint bucket tool or the OpenStudio Inspector. These changes are saved as part of your OpenStudio model.</p>

<p>The OpenStudio Render by Building Story mode renders each space based on the building story assigned to it. You can assign a building story to a space using the "Set Attributes for Selected Spaces" tool or the OpenStudio Inspector. When a new story is made, a color will be assigned to it. You can change that color by using SketchUp's paint bucket tool or the OpenStudio Inspector. These changes are saved as part of your OpenStudio model.</p>
<p>When you use the "Create Spaces from Diagram" tool to generate a multistory building the stories are assigned as part of that process. There is also a user script that can infer building stories from a model that has none assigned.</p>

<h4 id="render-by-layer">Render by Layer</h4>
<p>The Render by Layer is a standard SketchUp feature. It will render content by layer. You can create layers to represent anything you want to track. For example, to organize your project by space types you can create or move zones to specific layers. Keep in mind that the layer structure isn't saved with the OSM file, so any layers you setup are just for your current session.</p>

<h4 id="render-by-surface-normal">Render by Surface Normal</h4>
<p>The Render by Surface Normal mode is built on the SketchUp face setting where faces are rendered with the default front and back colors as opposed to their assigned materials. The outside face of a heat transfer surface will render white and the inside face will render red. This works as a quick diagnostic tool to look for reversed faces. In a clean model you shouldn't see red from the outside. Shading surfaces are an exception to this where you will see red on one of the two sides of each shading surface.</p>

<p>This opens SketchUp's native Shadow Settings window. The Shadow Settings window does a few things. First, it can turn SketchUp's shadow display on and off. It can also alter how shadows are rendered. Most important to OpenStudio users is that it can set the time of day and time of year for the current display. SketchUp uses this along with the model's geo-location to set the shadow orientation and length. OpenStudio leverages this data to inform time-series render modes. Currently, this includes the Render by Data render mode which displays post simulation results from an external SQL file. Moving the date or time slider will alter the surface or zone variable values rendered to the model.</p>
